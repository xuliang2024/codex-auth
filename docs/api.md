# API Refresh

This document is the single source of truth for outbound ChatGPT API refresh behavior in `codex-auth`.

All API refresh requests are issued through `Node.js fetch`.
When `codex-auth` is launched from the npm package, the wrapper passes its current Node executable to the Zig binary.
Legacy standalone binary installs must have Node.js 22+ available on `PATH` for API-backed refresh to work.
Built-in Node environment-proxy support for `fetch()` requires Node.js `22.21.0+` or `24.0.0+`.

`codex-auth` configures proxy support for the fetch child process in this order:

1. inherit explicit `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` values from the parent process
2. map `ALL_PROXY` into `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` when the direct variables are absent
3. on Windows only, when no proxy environment variables are present and the detected Node runtime supports env-proxy for `fetch()` (`22.21.0+` or `24.0.0+`), read `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings` and map HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS `ProxyServer` entries into `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY`
4. on Windows only, map explicit `ProxyOverride` entries into `NO_PROXY`; the WinINet-only `<local>` shorthand is not translated
5. when proxy variables are configured and the detected Node runtime supports env-proxy for `fetch()`, set `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` for the Node child process automatically

## Endpoints

### Usage Refresh

- method: `GET`
- URL: `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`
- headers:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <tokens.access_token>`
  - `ChatGPT-Account-Id: <chatgpt_account_id>`
  - browser-style `User-Agent` header

### Account Metadata Refresh

- method: `GET`
- URL: `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/accounts/check/v4-2023-04-27`
- headers:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <tokens.access_token>`
  - `ChatGPT-Account-Id: <chatgpt_account_id>`
  - browser-style `User-Agent` header

The `accounts/check` response is parsed by `chatgpt_account_id`. `name: null` and `name: ""` are both normalized to `account_name = null`.

## Usage Refresh Rules

- foreground refresh uses the usage API by default.
- `--skip-api` reads only the newest local `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`.
- by default, `list` and interactive `switch` refresh all stored accounts before rendering, using stored auth snapshots under `accounts/` with a maximum concurrency of `3`
- when one of those per-account foreground usage requests returns a non-`200` HTTP status, the corresponding `list` / `switch` row shows that response status in both usage columns until a later successful refresh replaces it
- when a stored account snapshot cannot make a ChatGPT usage request because it is missing the required ChatGPT auth fields, the corresponding `list` / `switch` row shows `MissingAuth` in both usage columns until a later successful refresh replaces it
- with `--skip-api`, foreground refresh still uses only the active local rollout data because local session files do not identify the other stored accounts
- `list` and interactive `switch` use the API-backed path by default; `--api` is accepted as an explicit equivalent
- `list --skip-api` and interactive `switch --skip-api` disable the foreground usage API path for that command
- in `switch --live`, the initial live display and later refreshed displays trigger a foreground auto-switch when the active account shows `0%` on the 5h window, `0%` on the weekly window, or a numeric non-`200` usage API status overlay for the active row
- `switch --live` still excludes errored rows from candidate selection, and it also skips candidates whose current displayed 5h or weekly value is already `0%`
- with `--skip-api`, `list` and `switch --live` can still refresh only the active account from local rollout data; non-active `switch` rows and non-active foreground auto-switch candidates still come from stored registry data
- single-shot `switch --skip-api` skips the pre-render refresh round entirely and shows the stored registry picker directly
- `switch <query>` always resolves selectors locally from stored data and does not accept `--live`, `--api`, or `--skip-api`
- interactive `remove`, including `remove --live`, always stays local-only and never makes foreground usage API requests
- `remove <query>` and `remove --all` always resolve selectors from stored local data and do not accept `--live`
- single-shot `switch` does not perform another foreground usage refresh after the new account is activated
- in `switch --live`, a successful selection patches the current picker state in memory instead of rebuilding it from disk; the active account and `Switched to ...` message both come from the persisted registry state after the local switch succeeds, while the current display keeps its existing usage/account overlays, including any overlay already shown on the newly active row, until the next scheduled live refresh reapplies fresh data asynchronously
- in `switch --live`, a successful manual selection immediately re-runs the foreground auto-switch check on that patched current display instead of waiting for the next scheduled refresh; if the newly active row still shows `0%` or a numeric non-`200` usage overlay in the current display, the auto-switch loop may switch away again right away
- in `remove --live`, a successful delete also patches the current picker state in memory; removed rows disappear immediately, surviving overlays stay in place until the next scheduled refresh, and the surviving active account plus the `Removed ...` summary come from the persisted registry state after removal succeeds
- the auto-switch daemon refreshes the current active account usage during each cycle when `auto_switch.enabled = true`
- the auto-switch daemon may also refresh a small number of non-active candidate accounts from stored snapshots so it can score switch candidates
- the daemon usage paths are cooldown-limited; see [docs/auto-switch.md](./auto-switch.md) for the broader runtime loop

## Account Name Refresh Rules

- Account-name refresh uses the account API by default.
- A usable ChatGPT auth context with both `access_token` and `chatgpt_account_id` is required. If either value is missing, refresh is skipped before any request is sent.
- `login` refreshes immediately after the new active auth is ready.
- Single-file `import` refreshes immediately for the imported auth context.
- `list` and interactive `switch` refresh account names by default; `--api` is accepted as an explicit equivalent.
- `list --skip-api` and interactive `switch --skip-api` skip account-name refresh and use stored metadata only.
- `switch <query>` always stays local-only and does not accept `--live`, `--api`, or `--skip-api`.
- `remove <query>` and `remove --all` always stay local-only and do not accept `--live`.
- `list` and interactive `switch` load the request auth context from the current active `auth.json` when they do refresh.
- the auto-switch daemon still uses a grouped-scope scan during each cycle when `auto_switch.enabled = true`.
- daemon refreshes load the request auth context from stored account snapshots under `accounts/` and do not depend on the current `auth.json` belonging to the scope being refreshed.
- when multiple stored ChatGPT snapshots exist for one grouped scope, daemon refreshes pick the snapshot with the newest `last_refresh`.
- stored snapshots without a usable `access_token` or `chatgpt_account_id` are skipped.
- daemon refreshes do not backfill missing `plan` or `auth_mode` from stored snapshots before deciding whether a grouped Team scope qualifies.

At most one `accounts/check` request is attempted per grouped user scope in a given refresh pass.
Request failures and unparseable responses are non-fatal and leave stored `account_name` values unchanged.

## Refresh Scope

Grouped account-name refresh always operates on one `chatgpt_user_id` scope at a time.

- `login` and single-file `import` start from the just-parsed auth info
- `list` and interactive `switch` start from the current active auth info when foreground refresh is enabled
- the auto-switch daemon scans registry-backed grouped scopes and refreshes each qualifying scope independently

That scope includes:

- all records with the same `chatgpt_user_id`

`chatgpt_user_id` is the user identity for this flow. A single user may have multiple workspace `chatgpt_account_id` values, and those workspaces can include personal and Team records under the same email.

This means a `free`, `plus`, or `pro` record can still trigger a grouped Team-name refresh when it belongs to the same `chatgpt_user_id` as Team records.

`accounts/check` is attempted only when:

- the scope contains more than one record
- the scope contains at least one Team record
- at least one Team record in that scope still has `account_name = null`

## Apply Rules

After a successful `accounts/check` response:

- returned entries are matched by `chatgpt_account_id`
- matched records overwrite the stored `account_name`, even when a Team record already had an older value
- in-scope Team records, or in-scope records that already had an `account_name`, are cleared back to `null` when they are not returned by the response
- records outside the scope are left unchanged

## Examples

Example 1:

- active record: `user@example.com / Team #1 / account_name = null`
- same grouped scope: `user@example.com / Team #2 / account_name = null`

Running `codex-auth list` should issue `accounts/check`. If the API returns:

- `team-1 -> "Workspace Alpha"`
- `team-2 -> "Workspace Beta"`

Then both grouped Team records are updated.

Example 2:

- active record: `user@example.com / Pro / account_name = null`
- same grouped scope: `user@example.com / Team #1 / account_name = null`
- same grouped scope: `user@example.com / Team #2 / account_name = "Old Workspace"`

Running `codex-auth list` should still issue `accounts/check`, because the grouped scope still has missing Team names. If the API returns:

- `team-1 -> "Prod Workspace"`
- `team-2 -> "Sandbox Workspace"`

Then:

- `Team #1` is filled with `Prod Workspace`
- `Team #2` is overwritten from `Old Workspace` to `Sandbox Workspace`

The same grouped-scope rule also applies to synchronous `list` / interactive `switch` refreshes and to the auto-switch daemon.
